Image classification using Convolution Neural Networks


This repository contains an Implementation of Convolution Neural Networks for an image classification dataset.
The .ipynb contains the complete code with comments explaining every part of the code.
The .pptx file contains further details about this implementation.

The code is written in Python3 using machine learning and deep learning packages like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
